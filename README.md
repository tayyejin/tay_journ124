# Survey of Flying etiquette

This is a survey result of flying etiquette, question being *Is it rude to ask someone to switch seats with you in order to be closer to friends?*.
I picked this question because it is a common situation that can easily occur to all of us! :joy:

The answer choices were:
> No, not at all rude
> Yes, somewhat rude
> Yes, very rude

**No, not at all rude** resulted to have the most pick.
> No, not at all rude : 631
> ~~Yes, somewhat rude~~ : 184
> ~~Yes, very rude~~ : 35
